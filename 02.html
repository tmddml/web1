  </ol>
  <h2>Etymology</h2>
<p>There are two competing arguments on the origin of kkondae.<p>The first theory claims that the word kondaegi, which means a pupa in the South Gyeongsang Province dialect, is the origin: The folded skin of a pupa reminds the wrinkles of an old man, so the word might have become a representation of an old man.</p><p>The other theory suggests the French nobility title fr:comte (count) is the basis of the word kkondae. <br>During the Japanese occupation of Korea, pro-Japanese politicians such as Lee Wan-yong received nobility titles from the Japanese government. <br>They proudly called themselves kkondae, hence it might have been developed into a slang later.</p></P>
<p><h4>The late 20th century</h4></p>
<p>Originally, the word <strong>kkondae</strong> meant simply an old man in a profane way.<br>During the late 1960s when industrialization and westernization were in full swing in South Korea, the word also began to refer to (classroom) teachers. <br>Students, who were not satisfied with the outdated school environment, would dismiss teachers from the older generation as old-fashioned beings. <br>Hence, the word <strong>kkondae</strong> became a slang used by students.</P>
