  <h2>Meaning of 'Kkondae'</h2>
  <p><strong>Kkondae</strong> is an expression used in South Korea to describe <u>a condescending person</u> .
  <br><a href="https://ko.dict.naver.com/#/search?query=%EA%BC%B0%EB%8C%80&range=all"target="_blank"title="korean dictionary">The slang noun kkondae</a> was originally used by students and teenagers to refer to older people such as fathers and teachers.
  <br>Recently, however, the word has been used to refer to a boss or an older person who does so-called kkondae-jil (acting like a kkondae, in the Korean language),<br>that forces the former's outdated way of thinking onto another person.</p>
